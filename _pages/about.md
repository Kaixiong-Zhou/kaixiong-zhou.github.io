I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. Prior to joining NCSU, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working on drug discovery and synthetic biology with [Prof. James J. Collins](https://be.mit.edu/directory/james-j-collins). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Rice University, 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). I received the Bachelor degree from Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in 2015, and received the Master degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2018.
